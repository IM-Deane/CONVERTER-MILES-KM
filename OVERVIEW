# CONVERTER-MILES-KM

Current Version: 1.0

Description:
CONVERTER-MILES-KM is a trivial unit converion program that accepts a unit type in the form of miles or kilometers
as well as a distance value. Once these two values are collected the program will convert the unit to its opposite 
(miles to km or vice-versa).
After this task is complete the program will display the results to the console and then terminate.

Exception Handling:
Version 1.0 comes equipped with a basic exception handler that detects when an invalid unit type is entered, and 
repeatedly prompts the user to enter a valid unit (km/miles). Once the correct unit is entered the program will
continue as usual.

Future Implementations:
This version is just a barebones concept and is rather trivial. In future versions I intend to flesh things out 
by adding various features.

Some ideas include:

- Merge the two input statements into a single prompt that allows the user to include the unit type with the
distance value. 
Ex: "Enter a distance (eg. 5 km): 26 miles" 
"Output: 26 miles == 41.84 km"

- Create two separate functions such as 'ConvertKm' and 'ConvertMi' that can be called from the main function. This should
enhance reuseablity and readability of the programs main function.

- Give the user the option to convert a value again rather than have to restart the program.
